behave4cmd0: Behave for Commands (variant 0)
==============================================================================

:Category: BDD, testing
:License:  BSD
:Status:   Incubating (coming soon)

This project provides a reusable `step-library`_ for `behave`_ to test:

* commands
* command-line applications (console apps)

It was heavily inspired by `cucumber.aruba`_ that is used by `cucumber`_.

Otherwise:

* It used by `behave`_ for testing `behave`_ (by biting itself in its tail) ;-)
* It is the small brother of `behave4cmd`_ (that was not released to public yet)

SEE ALSO:

* Current state: `behave4cmd0 <https://github.com/behave/behave/tree/main/behave4cmd0>`_ (as part of `behave`_)
* Example: `features/step.use_step_library.feature`_
